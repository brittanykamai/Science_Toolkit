# Science Presentations
Here are some presentations that I have made


**Ipython notebook tutorial**
* I think ipython is a helpful collaborative way of conducting research
* I put this together to help students get of sense of why
* This is useful for leading an activity with incoming students to research


**Sed, grep and awk tutorials**
* These tutorials were made a while ago while I was the "computational guru " in Vanderbilt's astronomy group
* They are helpful for launching in to these commands
